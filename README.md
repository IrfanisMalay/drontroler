# Drontroler

**Drontroler** is a customizable controller system designed for modding RC (Remote Control) vehicles using the **BBC micro:bit**. It allows makers, hobbyists, and educators to repurpose old RC cars or build new ones with programmable, wireless control using micro:bit's sensors and radio communication.

## 🚗 What is Drontroler?

Drontroler is a DIY modding solution that turns any compatible RC vehicle into a smart, programmable car. It uses the **micro:bit** as the core controller, enabling wireless communication between a handheld micro:bit-based controller.

## 🎮 Features

- 📡 **Wireless Control** using micro:bit's built-in radio
- 🕹️ **Tilt, Button, or Joystick**-based input
- 🔄 **Bi-directional Communication** (optional)
- 🔌 **Simple Wiring** to RC motor driver boards
- 🧠 **Customizable Code** with MakeCode or Python

## 🧰 What You Need

### Hardware

- 2x Battery AA for Microbit battery pack
- 1/2x [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/)
- RC Vehicle (DC motor-based, not proprietary digital signal systems)
- Battery packs (for micro:bit)
- Battery for RC vehicle(Lithium based or normal AA/AAA battery)
- Optional: Joystick module, buttons, LEDs, or sensors

### Software

- [Microsoft MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) or [MicroPython](https://python.microbit.org/)

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Controller Side (micro:bit #1)

- Uses built-in **accelerometer** or **buttons** to capture user input
- Sends direction/speed commands via **radio**

### Vehicle Side (micro:bit #2)

- Receives commands via **radio**
- Converts signals to control **motors** using a motor driver board

## 🛠️ Example Use Case

1. Mount a micro:bit onto your RC car and connect it to a motor driver.
2. Write a MicroPython or MakeCode program to listen for radio commands.
3. On a second micro:bit, write code to send radio signals based on button presses or tilt.
4. Power both devices and go wireless!
